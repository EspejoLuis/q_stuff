# Quantitative Finance Implementations

I’m sharing this repository as part of my ongoing review of quantitative finance concepts. 

I’ll be using it to organize notes, add links to the videos and books I’m studying, and document my progress. 

The repo features implementations of Monte Carlo methods, variance reduction, PDE/finite-difference solvers, and Greeks estimation — built with AI support but fully reviewed, refined, and understood by me. It will increase overtime.

If it’s here, it’s because I’ve worked through it carefully and understood it in depth.

## TO DO

- Check the Monte Carlo engine, in n_steps=1 gives you 2 values (t_0 - zeros and t_1) should it give you just t_1 ?
- Noticing that a lot of code could be reuse...better to live the code in the ipynb to make it easier for people to understand or put the code in a code base and call the functions in the notebook ? It's like ipynb should be used for Showing the results only or the code as well ?
  - It might be good to have both ? i.e. Notebook that explain the code, One that explain the results (more theoretical) and the code base as well ?
