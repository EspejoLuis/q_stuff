# Quantitative Finance Implementations

This repository contains a collection of quantitative implementations in the area of derivative pricing and risk modeling — including Monte Carlo simulations, 
finite difference (PDE) solvers, and Greeks estimation (Delta, Vega) with variance reduction techniques.

I genuinely believe that AI is transforming quantitative finance. If we think it won’t, we risk being left behind. 
AI is making model building more democratic — anyone can create complex implementations almost instantly. 

The true differentiating factor will be who can explain, interpret, and truly understand what’s being built.
Everything here has been created with the support of AI, but reviewed, refined, and annotated by me. 

If it’s here, it’s because I’ve worked through it carefully and understood it in depth.
